      <description>I have a project called replicate_warren (a private Github repository), where I am trying to replicate a sociology study, Warren (2019). To put it succinctly, Warren (2019) collected data from résumés of sociology PhD graduates and measured how over-achieving recent PhD graduates had to be to land a junior faculty jobs at top sociology departments in the United States. I want to replicate the study in the political science field.</description>
