<p><em>This blog post is part of my “JMP by women in econ” series where I summarize and review some of the job market papers written by women PhD candidates. The papers are selected from Jennifer Doleac’s <a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferdoleac/status/1187863251947806720">Twitter thread</a>.</em></p>
<p>I am reviewing Yi Cheng’s job market paper, <a href="https://asit-prod-web1.cc.columbia.edu/econdept/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2019/09/YiCheng_JMP_current.pdf">“The Unexpected Costs of Expertise: Evidence from Highly Specialized Physicians.”</a> This is a very interesting paper that investsigates the relationship between the quality of care and patient health outcome. Its research question is, <em>“What are the productivity and patient outcome effects of giving intensive care by a highly-skilled physician to a low-risk patient?”</em> The result is not only wasteful but harmful than if the same patient had been assigned to less intesive care by more generically trained physician.</p>
<p>The current debate on health care in the United States revolves around reducing the cost of health insurance. There is a vociferous demand for a more affordable health insurance payment model. Beneath that demand is the unchecked assumption that we would still be given the appropriate kind and level of medical care. The book that comes to my mind during this debate is Christy Ford Chapin’s <em>Ensuring America’s Health</em>, which traces how the current health insurance system came to be. What Chapin finds is that apart from the pricing mechanism, the ills of the current model cannot be cured without designing incentives for doctors to give the appropriate care to their patients. I see Cheng’s paper as complementing Chapin’s work in that they respectively examine the macro-level and micro-level mechanism behind the inefficient resource allocation of current American health care system.</p>
<div id="research-design" class="section level2">
<h2>Research design</h2>
<p>The research question is, “What is the effect of matching intensive care treatment administered by highly-skilled physician to a low-risk patient?”, i.e.</p>
<ul>
<li>the treatment is physician-patient (mis)match, and</li>
<li>the outcome is the patient’s health as measured by days to discharge, remission rate, and hospital charge.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we were gods and were to run a randomized controlled treatment (RCT) experiment, we would match patients and physicians randomly so that there will be cases of physician-patient mismatches generated randomly. But in reality, highly skilled physicians are assigned to treat high-risk patients that could benefit from the physician’s specialty. In other words, there is a <em>selection mechanism</em> behind the treatment assignment. Furthermore, this is a kind of stuation where an RCT would be considered unethical.</p>
<p>This is where the paper really shines through ✨. Cheng looks at the unscheduled admission of high-risk newborns, who are defined as <em>vaginally delivered newborns with very low birth weight</em> (7-8). Unscheduled admission of these high-risk patients creates a situation where there is a sudden demand in the neonatal care unit for highly technical physicians. The lower risk patients who were admitted just before this demand shock are now likely to be treated by the specialized physicians who were called in. So, we have</p>
<ul>
<li>a <em>treatment group</em> consisting of newborns whose hospital stay overlaps with the unscheduled high-risk newborns and</li>
<li>a <em>control group</em> consisting of newborns whose hospital stay do not overlap with any unscheduled high-risk newborn admission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, we need to check that these groups are valid treatment-control pair: the two groups must be similar in all aspects except that the treatment group is more likely to be matched with specialized physicians than the control group.</p>
