My name is Asako. I recently mastered out of a PhD program in political science. I received my BA from Smith College where I majored in Government and minored in Mathematics. 

I have been studying political science for almost 9 years, but during my PhD training, I have found my calling in data science and am looking to start my career in the field.

This website is my little corner on the Internet that I mainly use to practice writing in English. Right now as of `r format(Sys.time(), '%B %d, %Y')`, the topics are limited to Python/R tutorials and reviews of academic research papers.

This website was built using the `blogdown` package in R and Hugo {{ .Hugo.version }}. The current theme I'm using is [paperesque](https://themes.gohugo.io/paperesque/) by Fabian Tamp except that the sidenotes are not working due to some conflict with `blogdown`. Here are some awesome resources that helped me get this website up and running. 

- Dave Robinson's blogpost, ["Advice to aspiring data scientists: start a blog"](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) for the inspiration to start this blog
- Alison Presmane Hill's blogpost, ["Up and running with blogdown"](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) on how to get quickly started with `blogdown` in R Studio
- Brooke Watson's blogost, ["Custom domain hosting with GitHub and Namecheap"](https://blog.brooke.science/posts/custom-domain-hosting-with-github-and-namecheap/) on how to deploy your website with a custom domain
