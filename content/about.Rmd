My name is Asako. I am a PhD student in political science at Boston University. I received my BA from Smith College where I majored in Government and minored in Mathematics. 

I have been studying political science for almost 9 years, but during my PhD training, I have found my calling in data science and am looking to start my career in the field. 

My blog showcases my working projects, R/Python tutorials for data collection, and notes. You can reach me via
