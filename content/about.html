<p>My name is Asako. I recently mastered out of a PhD program in political science. I received my BA from Smith College where I majored in Government and minored in Mathematics.</p>
<p>I have been studying political science for almost 9 years, specializing in research methodology and principles of reproducible research for the last 5 years. I want to help others with the knowledge and skills I cultivated from my methodology studies.</p>

<p>This website is my little corner on the Internet where I publish my tutorials and pieces of writing. As of June 24, 2020, the topics are limited to Python/R tutorials and reviews of academic research papers, but I plan to expand my content range over the next few months.</p>
