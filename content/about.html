<p>My name is Asako. I recently mastered out of a PhD program in political science. I received my BA from Smith College where I majored in Government and minored in Mathematics.</p>
<p>I have been studying political science for almost 9 years, but during my PhD training, I have found my calling in data science and am looking to start my career in the field.</p>

<p>This website is my little corner on the Internet that I mainly use to practice writing in English. Right now as of June 21, 2020, the topics are limited to Python/R tutorials and reviews of academic research papers.</p>

<p>This website was built using the <code>blogdown</code> package in R and Hugo {{ .Hugo.version }}. The current theme I’m using is <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/paperesque/">paperesque</a> by Fabian Tamp except that the sidenotes are not working due to some conflict with <code>blogdown</code>. Here are some awesome resources that helped me get this website up and running.</p>
