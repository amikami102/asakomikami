<p>My name is Asako. I am a PhD student in political science at Boston University. I received my BA from Smith College where I majored in Government and minored in Mathematics.</p>
<p>I have been studying political science for almost 9 years, but during my PhD training, I have found my calling in data science and am looking to start my career in the field.</p>

<p>This website is my little corner on the Internet where I can write down things that don’t neatly fit in 240 words. I’m doing this mainly to practice writing in English, and I’m hoping to expand the range of topics I write here.</p>

<p>This website was built using the <code>blogdown</code> package in R and Hugo {{ .Hugo.version }}. The current theme I’m using is <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/paperesque/">paperesque</a> by Fabian Tamp except that the sidenotes are not working due to some conflict with <code>blogdown</code>. Here are some awesome resources that helped me get this website up and running.</p>
