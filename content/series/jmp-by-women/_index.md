title: "JMP by Women In Economics"
---

This is a series of blog posts where I write summary reviews of job market papers written by women graduating from Economics PhD programs in 2020. The papers are selected from Jennifer Doleac's [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/jenniferdoleac/status/1187863251947806720) in which she includes the links to the papers and the screenshot of their abstract in each tweet. There are both theoretical and empirical papers, but since economics is not my field of expertise, I will almost always be reviewing an empirical paper where my knowledge of statistics and causal inference can help me comprehend the research design and results. Even among empirical papers, I am more likely to review an observational study rather than an experimental one. 

When I review these papers, I will state the research question and explain what some of the challenges are to identifying the causal effect with observational data, namely a selection bias, omitted variable bias, or simultaneity. Then, I explain the research design by stating what the treated and control groups are, describing how the author constructs them, and writing out the regression equation. Since there's a lot to unpackk in each paper, I choose the most interesting components from the results section to talk about. 

I usually don't have anything but positive to say about these papers. First of all, as someone who decided to not do the dissertation and drop out of PhD, I am coming from a place of admiration. Reviewing these papers is in sort my act of giving them my congratulations. Second, I don't want to be wrong, so I don't want to take the risk of making an incorrect criticism. Moreover, these papers are honest about their limitations when it comes to their external validity, so I would not bother reiterating what the authors know to be their papers' weakenesses. Instead, I might point out parts that are unclear and wish were elaborated further. 

Finally, all the images of tables and figures come from the most recent version of the paper as of each blog post's publication date. I do not own the rights to these images unless otherwise stated.
