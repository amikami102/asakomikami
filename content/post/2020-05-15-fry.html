<p><em>This blog post is part of my “JMP by Women in Econ” series where I summarize and review some of the job market papers written by women PhD candidates in Economics. The papers are selected from Jennifer Doleac’s <a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferdoleac/status/1187863251947806720">Twitter thread</a>. DISCLAIMER: I am not reading this from the perspective of an economist, let alone of a job committee member. I just like reading cool articles that use observational data to tackle challenging research problems.</em> :bowtie:</p>
<p>The third installment in this series is Caroline Fry’s paper, “Building Bridges: The impact of migration by African scientists.” I chose this paper to add to my personal collection of “Clever Research Designs on Network Effects.” The corpus so far includes Azoulay, Zivin, and Wang (2010) “Superstar Extinction” and Jaffe et al. (2019) “Geographic Localization of Knowledge Spillovers as Evidenced by Patent Citations.” I’m thrilled to add a new paper to this collection.</p>
